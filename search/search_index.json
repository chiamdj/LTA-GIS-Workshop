In this lab, you will plot the location of the two new bus stops in a GIS dataset. 1.1 Adding a basemap In this step you will create a new ArcGIS Pro project and add a basemap. Click the Start Menu, expand ArcGIS and click on ArcGIS Pro to launch the ArcGIS Pro client. Tip If a licence dialog box appears, alert one of the trainers to help you configure your ArcGIS Pro client to connect to LTA's on-premises licencing server. Once ArcGIS Pro launches, under the middle column titled New , click on Map . You will be prompted to enter a name for the new project. Enter Lab1 and click OK . Info It will take a couple of minutes for ArcGIS Pro to create and open the project. Tip Take note of where your project will be stored under the Location field. By default, it will be stored at C:\\Users\\<your WOG ID>\\Documents\\ArcGIS\\Projects . You will need to navigate to this directory in File Explorer to access the data and files that you create. When you first open a new map in ArcGIS Pro, you will only see a blank canvas. You will need to first add a basemap , which will serve as the foundation for your maps and provide context for your work. Using ArcGIS Pro in WOG machines If you are using ArcGIS Pro from your WOG machine, do take note that you will not be able to access the basemaps provided by Esri due to firewall connectivity issues. You may however leverage on our in-house designed Ignite Colour basemap, which will be demonstrated in the following steps. If you access ArcGIS Pro from your Internet machine or the Internet-enabled Workstations in the DLab, you can use the basemaps provided by Esri. Next, we will add a basemap to your map. Under the Map Tab and the Layer subgroup, click on the Add Data drop down menu. Select Data from Path . Enter the following path: http://web.gdm1.sso1.lta.gov.sg/arcgis/rest/services/GDM/LTA_Basemap_Colour/MapServer Leave all other settings as default and click Add . The basemap will be added to the Contents pane on the left. Right click on the layer and click on Zoom To Make Visible . The basemap should appear on the map. Click on the Save icon at the top left or press Ctrl + S to save your project. Accessing Ignite Colour basemap from Internet machine If you are accessing ArcGIS Pro from an Internet machine, do use this URL instead: https://ignite.lta.gov.sg/arcgis/rest/services/Ignite_Basemap_Colour/MapServer 1.2 Creating a new feature class Feature classes are homogeneous collections of common features, each having the same spatial representation (such as points, lines, or polygons) and a common set of attributes (for example, a line feature class for representing road centerlines). The four most commonly used feature classes are points, lines, polygons, and annotation . In the illustration below, these feature classes are used to represent four datasets for the same area: Manhole cover locations as points Sewer lines Parcel polygons Street name annotation Different feature class types can be used to represent different phenomena. Read the table below to learn more. Feature class type Description Points Features that are too small to represent as lines or polygons as well as point locations (such as GPS observations). Lines Represent the shape and location of geographic objects, such as street centerlines and streams, too narrow to depict as areas. Lines are also used to represent features that have length but no area, such as contour lines and boundaries. Polygons A set of many-sided area features that represents the shape and location of homogeneous feature types such as states, counties, parcels, soil types, and land-use zones. Annotation Map text including properties for how the text is rendered. For example, in addition to the text string of each annotation, other properties are included such as the shape points for placing the text, its font and point size, and other display properties. Annotation can also be feature linked and can contain subclasses. Multipatches A 3D geometry used to represent the outer surface, or shell, of features that occupy a discrete area or volume in three-dimensional space. Multipatches comprise planar 3D rings and triangles that are used in combination to model a three-dimensional shell. You can use multipatches to represent anything from simple objects, such as spheres and cubes, to complex objects, such as iso-surfaces and buildings. In this step, you will create a feature class from an existing shapefile. Open the Catalog Pane (if it is not already open). It should be docked on the right side of the application. Click Folders in the Contents pane. Expand Lab1 . That folder contains all the files in your ArcGIS Pro project. Tip Before creating a Feature Class, you need to first create a geodatabase, which is essentially Esri's proprietary data format for storing feature classes. By default, a geodatabase named Lab1.gdb should have already been created for you. Right click Lab1.gdb and hover on New > Feature Class . Under Name , enter NewBusStop . Under Feature Class Type , select Point . Click Finish. The NewBusStop Feature Class will be added to your map. What is the difference between a Feature class and a Shapefile? When working with geospatial datasets, sometimes you might come across another common format known as the shapefile . It is a traditional Esri vector data storage format for storing the location, shape, and attributes of geographic features. Shapefiles are made up of a combination of related files containing at least the .shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files components, and usually packaged into a .zip file for easy sharing. A feature class on the other hand must be stored inside a geodatabase which in turn comprises of hundreds of small files. The shapefile is a format that is compatible with both ArcGIS products and open source GIS software such as QGIS. If you need to share GIS data with a colleague who does not have access to ArcGIS Pro, you should export it to a shapefile. Read more about shapefiles here . 1.3 Move a feature to a specified location Next, you will use the Editor tool in ArcGIS Pro to create a bus stop feature a specific lat-lon coordinate. About the Move To tool The Move To tool moves selected features from the geometric center (centroid) of the selection set to a specified x,y,z location, an x,y,z distance from its current location, or a direction, 3D angular pitch, and distance. This tool is available in the Modify Features pane. On the ribbon, click the Edit tab. In the Features group, click Create. The Create Features pane opens on the right. Click on the NewBusStop feature template. Click anywhere within the boundary of Singapore to place a point. On the ribbon, click the Edit tab. In the Features group, click Modify . In the Modify Features pane, expand Alignment and click Move To . In the tool pane, click the Select tool and select the point you've just created. In the Move To tool, under the Method section, choose Absolute and enter the following coordinates: Longitude: 103.7438077 Latitude: 1.3884430 Repeat the previous five steps to add a point at this location: Longitude: 103.7440424 Latitude: 1.3893283 Under the Edit Tab and Manage Edits Group, click on Save to save your edits. Tip If you are creating or digitising a large number of features, remember to click the Save button regularly to avoid losing your changes. 1.4 Adding a new field Next, you will add a new field to the feature class to store the bus stop number for these bus stops. A primer on fields Fields are the components that provide structure for a table. Tables form the foundation of geographic data and are the fundamental building blocks of any data model. Tables are a collection of information, such as a list of building owners, employees, or customer information. Layers in a map, such as city streets, buildings, or address points, are essentially tables that include information about the geometry and location of those features. To open the fields view, first select NewBusStop in the Contents pane . This displays the Feature Layer tabs. Clicking the Data tab, you will find the Data Design group containing the Fields, Subtypes, and Domains buttons. These are your tools for working with a data model. Click the Fields button to open the fields view, which displays the layer's fields in a tabular arrangement. Accessing the fields view You may also access the fields view by opening the Attribute Table (right click the layer in the Contents Pane and click Attribute Table ) and then right clicking any column in the Attribute Table and selecting Fields . The Fields view allows you to manage the fields associated with a layer or table. As shown in the examples below, you can edit a layer's or table's fields, modify their properties, delete fields, or create fields using the Fields view. Example Description 1 Change the name and alias of a field. 2 Delete unnecessary fields. 3 Add a new field called BLDGTYPE to store the type of campus building. 4 Apply a domain to a field. 5 Apply a default value to a field. Click on Click here to add a new field to add a new field. Enter the following properties to the new field: Field Name: BUS_STOP_NUM Alias: Bus Stop Number Data Type: Text Food for thought Bus Stop Numbers exist in 5-digit numbers (e.g. 40385). Why do you think we store the numbers in text? Save your changes. On the Fields tab, in the Changes group, click Save . Open the Attribute Table of the NewBusStop layer by right clicking the layer in the Contents pane and click Attribute Table . The Attribute Table opens at the bottom of the application. Double click on a cell to add the Bus Stop number for both of the new features. Tip You may double click on a row in the Attribute Table to select and zoom to that particular feature. Info For more information on Creating and managing fields, refer to the documentation at https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/data/geodatabases/overview/create-modify-and-delete-fields.htm . 1.5 Spatial Analysis You want to see the spatial extent of this bus stop can improve connectivity for nearby residents. You can leverage on the buffer tool to do this. Under the Analysis Tab and Geoprocessing Group, click on Tools . The Geoprocessing panel appears at the right. Enter Buffer in the Find Tool text field. Click on the Buffer (Analysis Tools) tool. Under Input Features , select NewBusStop Under Distance , enter 400 meters. Leave all the other settings as it is and click on Run . Two buffer rings should be created around the two point features you've just created. Tip If you have selected any feature or highlighted any feature in the Attribute Table, the buffer tool (or any geoprocessing tool) will only perform the analysis on the selected features. To apply the (buffer) tool on all the features in the feature class, go to the Edit Tab, under Selection group click on Clear . This will clear the existing selection of features. Stretch goal Instructions Try completing the tasks below on your own. Should you need any help, refer to the instructions above, Google ArcGIS Pro followed by what you are trying to do, or consult a trainer. You are given a shapefile LampPost_Practice_1.shp containing the location of lamp posts (access it via OneDrive\\Daily Practices\\Exercise 1 ). You are tasked to perform the following: Convert the shapefile to a feature class Tip You may use the Feature Class to Feature Class geoprocessing tool (see below) to convert a shapefile to a feature class. Move LP No. 16 feature to the coordinate 1.30954262, 103.84757923 . Add a new field with the following properties: Field Name: LP_Installation_Date Alias Name: LP Installation Date Data Type: Date Using the field calculator, populate the field with the following dates based on their road name: Road Installation Date Bukit Timah Rd 17/01/2022 Hampshire Rd 11/02/2022 Kampong Java Rd 09/03/2021 Race Course Rd 23/08/2021 Tekka Ln 11/11/2021 Hint If there are any features selected, field calculator will only populate the field of those selected features.

Active Mobility Enforcement Officers (AMEO) from TRO (Traffic & Road Operations) have approached you to assistance to geotag their offence data onto a map. While they have recorded the location of the offence when issuing a ticket on the ground, this location is recorded in a textual format and have to be converted into latitude-longitude coordinates before they can be added to a map. This process is known as geocoding . What is geocoding? Geocoding is the process of transforming a description of a location\u2014such as a pair of coordinates, an address, or a name of a place\u2014to a location on the earth's surface. You can geocode by entering one location description at a time or by providing many of them at once in a table. The resulting locations are output as geographic features with attributes, which can be used for mapping or spatial analysis. For more information on geocoding, check out the documentation . 2.1 Create a new project Create a new ArcGIS Pro project titled Lab2 . Create a new map and add the Ignite Colour Basemap. Tip Refer to Lab 1 if you need detailed instructions for this step. Create a folder connection to access the datasets used in Lab 2. 2.2 Creating an Address Locator Navigate to Lab 2's data folder. Right click the BusStop point feature class and click on Open Table . The Attribute Table for BusStop opens. Create a Text field called Country . Right click your newly created Country field and click on Field Calculator . Under the Country = text field, enter 'SGP' (with quotes). Click OK . Your BusStop attribute table should look like this: Under the Analysis Tab and Geoprocessing Group, click on Tools . The Geoprocessing panel appears at the right. Enter Create Locator in the Find Tool text field. Click on the Create Locator (Geocoding Tools) tool. Enter the following inputs: Country or Region : As defined in data Primary Tables : Browse to the BusStop feature class. Role : POI Field Mapping : Select Bus Stop No for Place Name and Country for Country Code . Leave all other fields as None . Language Code : English Click OK to create the address locator. Your new address locator is created in your project directory. It will have a .loc file extension. 2.3 Geocoding AMEO feedback cases Add the offences_busstop.csv onto your map by dragging it from the Catalog Pane on the right to the Contents Pane on the left. Right click the tabular layer and click on Geocode Table . The GeoCode Table wizard appears. Tip This wizard will only open the first time you launch ArcGIS Pro. You can also access the geoprocessing tool by typing in Geocode Addresses . Important note on data structure If there are padded zeros (e.g. 04504), the zero in front will be removed when importing into ArcGIS Pro (i.e. 04504 will become 4504). You must duplicate the field containing the padded zeros to a new text field and add the padded zeros back. Follow the steps provided by the wizard. Save your output feature class as Offences_BusStop_geocoded in Lab2.gdb in your project directory. Under Optional parameters , for Output Fields select Location Only . Your final result should look like the following: Click Run to execute the geocoding process. When completed, you should see the offences automatically added on the map. 2.4 Spatial Join AMEO staff are also interested to know the nearest Town Council for each offence. In this step, you will add a NearestTownCouncil field to the Offences_BusStop_geocoded feature class and populate it with the name of its nearest Town Council . Add the TOWN_COUNCIL_BDY_2020 layer to your map. Right click the layer in the Contents pane and click Symbology . Click on the hamburger menu at the top right and click Import symbology... The Apply Symbology from Layer geoprocessing tool opens. Under Symbology Layer , browse to Town_Council_Bdy_2020.lyr file and click on Run . Your map should look like this: In the Contents pane, right click the Offences_BusStop_geocoded layer. Click on Joins and Relates > Spatial Join . The Spatial Join geoprocessing tool opens. In the Spatial Join , select the following: Target Features : Offences_BusStop_geocoded Join Features : TOWN_COUNCIL_BDY_2020 Output Feature Class : Offences_BusStop_TC Join Operation : Join one to one Match option : Intersect Fields : Expand fields and leave only the fields shown below (delete all other fields). A new feature class Offences_BusStop_TC is created in your project directory. Open the Attribute Table to take a look at the data. Notice that each offence now contains a column TOWN_COUNCIL stating the town council boundary the offence occured in. 2.5 Exporting data In this step, you will export the dataset created into an Excel file that can be submitted to AMEO colleagues. Open the Geoprocessing pane and search for Table to Excel . Open the Table to Excel (Conversion Tools) tool. Select Offences_BusStop_TC as the Input Table and browse for a directory to save the output file. 2.6 Geocoding offences tagged to POBs Now using the PedestrianOverheadBridge feature class, repeat Steps 2.2-2.5 to geocode offences_POB.csv . Save the output locator as POBLocator.loc and the geocoded offences as Offences_POB_geocoded . Use the Merge (Data Management Tools) geoprocessing tool to merge the Offences_BusStop_TC and Offences_POB_TC feature classes into a single Offences_TC feature class. 2.7 Map Symbology Identify and assign an appropriate symbology to visualise the spatial distribution and density of Offences_TC . Hint If you open the Attribute Table for Offences_POB_geocoded , you will see that many of the points are tagged at the exact same POB. Which symbology is most suitable to emphasis the concentration of these points in the map? Stretch goals (optional) Instructions Try completing the tasks below on your own. Should you need any help, refer to the instructions above, Google ArcGIS Pro followed by what you are trying to do, or consult a trainer. Now using the LampPost feature class, repeat the previous steps to geocode the offences with locations tagged at lamp posts in offences_lamppost.csv and append them to the Offences_TC feature class. Hint As the same Lamp Post No. could be duplicated across different roads, you will need to create a field that contains both the Road Name and the Lamp Post Number for both the LampPost feature class and Offences_lamppost.csv before creating the Address Locator. You can use the Append (Data Management Tools) tool to append a dataset to another dataset. With more offences captured every month, your AMEO colleagues have requested you to create a workflow that can repeat these steps on a monthly basis. Given a CSV file containing either a Bus Stop or a POB, create a model in ModelBuilder that will export a .csv file containing the nearest town council. Hint You may want to plan and sketch out a flow chart to visualise the workflow before building the model.","title":"Lab Practice #2"},{"location":"lab2/#lab-practice-2","text":"Learning Objectives In this lab exercise, you will learn the following: Create a custom Address Locator Geocoding Layer Symbology Spatial Join Data required: Lab2data.gdb containing BusStop point feature class LampPost point feature class PedestrianOverheadBridge polygon feature class TOWN_COUNCIL_BDY_2020 polygon feature class offences_BusStop.csv offences_POB.csv offences_LampPost.csv","title":"Lab Practice #2"},{"location":"lab2/#case-study","text":"Read the following case study below.

Should you need any help, refer to the instructions above, Google ArcGIS Pro followed by what you are trying to do, or consult a trainer. Now using the LampPost feature class, repeat the previous steps to geocode the offences with locations tagged at lamp posts in offences_lamppost.csv and append them to the Offences_TC feature class. Hint As the same Lamp Post No. could be duplicated across different roads, you will need to create a field that contains both the Road Name and the Lamp Post Number for both the LampPost feature class and Offences_lamppost.csv before creating the Address Locator. You can use the Append (Data Management Tools) tool to append a dataset to another dataset. With more offences captured every month, your AMEO colleagues have requested you to create a workflow that can repeat these steps on a monthly basis. Given a CSV file containing either a Bus Stop or a POB, create a model in ModelBuilder that will export a .csv file containing the nearest town council.
